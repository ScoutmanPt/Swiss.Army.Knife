## Summary ##

The **Scoutmans Swiss Army Knife** is a Windows Desktop app that lives happy on the Windows systray.  
It is a Windows Forms "ShortCut" builder tool where we can address direct links to files, folders, scripts (PNP Script Samples also!) and browser Profiles.

Excelsior, hum ? :P

## Details ##
As a consultant, i've been "collecting" a lot of tools, scripts, files, technical stuff along the way.  
I always had the need, to access all of those assets more promptly, so this tool was born. Not rocket science but it fits my need.  

Current release is a portable app version (no setup), it can be installed as a startup app and it is accessed through windows systray.  
Main idea : build ShortCuts and\or CmdLine snippets that we can be easily trigger with a click of a button.  

Through the years it grown to allow Cmdlines scripts in batch, node , powershell 5.1 and powershell core .  
  
Most recent added features are, options to :  
 
* Import all PnP Script Samples 
* Import Browser Profiles 


I also added an " Eggxamples " import option : self explanatory examples on shortcuts and cmdlines

Again, not rocket science , but it works .  

It was build for personal use, the only client that has access to it, is very happy and it is using it ... every day!  ("client" aka me!) 

Challenged by a couple of friends\clients on open sourcing some of my tools\widgets\scripts , I'll start by "open sourcing" this one.  
A blue bird told me that, this can be useful for the general community.  
Hope it will. :D  

Feel free to use it...

... and drop me a message if you think this is useful .
